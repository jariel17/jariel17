# Hi there, I'm Jaime Ariel! 👋

### 🐞 QA Engineer & 📊 Aspiring Data Scientist

I am a passionate learner bridging the gap between **Software Quality** and **Data Science**. 

I spent the early part of my career in Manual QA, developing a sharp eye for detail and user experience. Over the last year, I've leveled up into **Test Automation** while simultaneously learning about **Data Science**.

### 🚀 My Journey

I believe in continuous growth. Here is my current trajectory:

* **Past:** Mastered Manual QA methodologies, bug tracking, and user empathy.
* **Present:** Building Automation frameworks to create clean, maintainable tests.
* **Future:** My ultimate goal is to combine my testing discipline with data science to build, deploy, and monitor robust machine learning models.

### 🧠 What I'm Learning Right Now

I am a lifelong learner. I'm currently diving deep into:
1.  **Screenplay Pattern Best Practices:** Moving beyond Page Object Model to create more modular tests.
2.  **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Deepening my understanding of regression and classification models.
3.  **CI/CD Pipelines:** Learning to integrate my automated tests into deployment workflows.
